Shared Dependencies:

1. **Command Names**: "create", "list", "delete" - These are the command names used in the main.js file and their corresponding command files (create.js, list.js, delete.js).

2. **Utility Functions**: "config", "logger", "response", "server", "validator" - These are utility functions that are used across multiple files. They are defined in their respective files (config.js, logger.js, response.js, server.js, validator.js) and are imported where needed.

3. **Middleware Functions**: "delay", "logger", "response" - These are middleware functions used in the server.js file. They are defined in their respective files (delay.js, logger.js, response.js) and are imported in server.js.

4. **Test Files**: Each file has a corresponding test file in the tests directory. The test files import the file they are testing and may also import any necessary testing libraries.

5. **Package.json**: This file contains the metadata of the project like the project's dependencies, scripts, version, etc. It's shared among all the files as it's the configuration file for the project.

6. **README.md**: This file contains the documentation for the project. It's not directly shared with the other files but it's important for understanding how to use and contribute to the project.

7. **Command Line Arguments**: The command line arguments like "--endpoint", "--method", "--response-file" are shared between the main.js file and the command files (create.js, list.js, delete.js).

8. **HTTP Methods**: HTTP methods like "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE" are shared across the command files and the server.js file.

9. **Configuration File Formats**: JSON and YAML file formats are shared across the config.js file and any file that uses it.

10. **Mock API Data**: The mock API data (endpoint, method, response data) is shared across the command files, the server.js file, and the response.js file.
